# QVI Chip Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of chip sales and customer purchase behavior using the QVI (Quantium) dataset. The objective is to clean, examine, and analyze transaction and customer data to uncover sales drivers, customer segments, and product insights. These findings will inform targeted marketing recommendations and business decisions.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

- **Data Cleaning & Validation:**  
  Examine the transaction and purchase datasets for inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and categorization errors. Perform necessary cleaning such as removing extreme outliers and correcting product naming inconsistencies to ensure high-quality data.

- **Data Merging:**  
  Combine transaction data with customer purchase behavior data to establish a unified dataset ready for comprehensive analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  Explore sales trends, product performance, and customer purchase patterns through various visualizations such as histograms, density plots, boxplots, and bar charts. Key metrics analyzed include total sales, transactions per date, sales by product type, pack size, brand, and customer segments.

- **Customer Segmentation Analysis:**  
  Deep dive into customer segments by lifestyle and premium/budget status, analyzing sales, average spend, purchase frequency, and product preferences. Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) are conducted to determine significant differences between segments.

- **Insights & Recommendations:**  
  Identify which customer segments to target, optimal product pack sizes, and brand preferences. Highlight seasonal sales trends and marketing opportunities.

- **Output & Reporting:**  
  Save processed data and visualizations for use in formal reporting. Provide initial findings and actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Data Sources

- `QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv`: Customer purchase behavior data.
- `QVI_transaction_data.xlsx`: Detailed transaction records.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas — data manipulation
- numpy — numerical computations
- matplotlib & seaborn — data visualization
- scipy — statistical analysis

## Methodology

1. **Load & Inspect Data**  
   Read CSV and Excel files into pandas DataFrames; check data types, null values, and basic statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Convert date formats, handle missing data, remove outliers from numerical columns (`PROD_QTY`, `TOT_SALES`), and clean categorical data such as product names.

3. **Data Integration**  
   Merge transaction and purchase behavior datasets on loyalty card number.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Extract pack size, brand names, and create new columns such as transactions per date.

5. **Visual Analysis**  
   Generate histograms, boxplots, bar charts by product, brand, pack size, date, and customer segments.

6. **Statistical Testing**  
   Conduct t-tests to compare average prices and purchase behaviors between different customer groups.

7. **Segmentation & Insights**  
   Analyze sales distribution by lifestyle groups and premium customer status; calculate likelihood of brand purchases per segment.
